## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
